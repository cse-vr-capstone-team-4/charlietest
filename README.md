### Description of project

Our project is an Magic Leap AR "Island Colonization" video game where the player attempts to take over floating islands by defeating enemies. The player can switch between a high-level overview of the world where they distribute units to different floating islands and a low-level view where they actually walk onto the island and watch the battle themselves.

### Team members
- **Anny Kong**
    - I am a senior at UW majoring in computer science. While I am a big fan of VR/AR as well as great games, it's super exiciting to make a game with AR technologies.
- **Charles Mihran**
    - I am a senior in computer science at UW Settle, but I'm initially from the Bay Area in California. I grew up loving playing video games ranging from Halo to Pokemon and have been interested in game development for a while. I've made some games on my own but am excited to work on a team to creating a game in AR. When I was younger I loved games from the "Command and Conquer" series and am excited to make a strategy game of our own.
- **Xiuxing Lao**
    - I am a senior student in Computer Science at the University of Washington. I always believe that great story can be told in AR.
- **Yuyang Ge**
    - I am a senior studying computer science at UW Seattle. I am also minor in Music and Math, concentrated in biopsychology. I have developed games in the past for iOS system but this is the first time I get the oppotunity to development a game in AR. I believe that VR/AR will be an integral part of the furture, and I am very excited to be working with a team to make a strategy game of our own.
